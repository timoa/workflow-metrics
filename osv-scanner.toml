minimatch ReDoS via repeated wildcards. Affects @vscode/vsce and its transitive
dependency glob>minimatch. Upgrading minimatch to >=10.2.1 (the patched version)
is incompatible with @vscode/vsce due to the ESM-only migration in minimatch v10,
which breaks the CommonJS require() calls inside vsce. The vulnerability is only
exploitable when untrusted user input is passed directly as a glob pattern, which
does not occur in this build tooling context.
